# Robot Localization â€“ Lab 01

This project is part of the **Differential Drive Mobile Robot Labs**.  
It focuses on simulating and analyzing a 3 DOF differential drive robot, implementing pose compounding, and testing localization through dead reckoning.

## What I Did
- Implemented and completed the **DifferentialDriveSimulatedRobot** class for robot motion simulation.  
- Programmed and tested robot trajectories (circle and figure-8).  
- Worked with **pose compounding** in 3 DOF.  
- Implemented and tested **Dead Reckoning Localization** with the `DR_3DOFDifferentialDrive` class.  
- Verified results through simulation and visualization.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook (for lab exercises)
